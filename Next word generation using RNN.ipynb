    "  From fairest creatures we desire increase,\n",
    "  That thereby beauty's rose might never die,\n",
    "  But as the riper should by time decease,\n",
    "  His tender heir might bear his memory:\n",
    "  But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,\n",
    "  Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,\n",
    "  Making a famine where abundance lies,\n",
    "  Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:\n",
    "  Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,\n",
    "  And only herald to the gaudy spring,\n",
    "  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,\n",
    "  And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:\n",
    "    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,\n",
    "    To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.\n",
    "\n",

    "  When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,\n",
    "  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,\n",
    "  Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,\n",
    "  Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:\n",
    "  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,\n",
    "  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;\n",
    "  To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,\n",
    "  Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.\n",
    "  How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,\n",
    "  If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine\n",
    "  Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'\n",
    "  Proving his beauty by succession thine!\n",

    "  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?\n",
    "  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,\n",
    "  Of his self-love to stop posterity?\n",
    "  Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee\n",
    "  Calls back the lovely April of her prime;\n",
    "  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,\n",

    "  Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse\n",

    "  For never-resting time leads summer on\n",
    "  To hideous winter, and confounds him there;\n",
    "  Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,\n",
    "  Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:\n",
    "  Then were not summer's distillation left,\n",
    "  A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,\n",
    "  Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,\n",
    "  Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:\n",

    "  With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.\n",
    "  That use is not forbidden usury,\n",
    "  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;\n",
    "  That's for thy self to breed another thee,\n",
    "  Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;\n",
    "  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,\n",
    "  If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:\n",
    "  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,\n",
    "  Leaving thee living in posterity?\n",
    "    Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair\n",
    "    To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.\n",

    "  Lo! in the orient when the gracious light\n",
    "  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye\n",

    "  Serving with looks his sacred majesty;\n",
    "  And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,\n",
    "  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,\n",
    "  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,\n",
    "  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:\n",
    "  But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,\n",
    "  Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,\n",
    "  The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are\n",
    "  From his low tract, and look another way:\n",
    "    So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:\n",
    "    Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.\n",
    "\n",
    "  VIII\n",
    "\n",
    "  Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?\n",
    "  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:\n",

    "  Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?\n",
    "  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,\n",
    "  By unions married, do offend thine ear,\n",
    "  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds\n",
    "  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.\n",
    "  Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,\n",
    "  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;\n",
    "  Resembling sire and child and happy mother,\n",
    "  Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:\n",

    "    Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'\n",

    "  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;\n",

    "  Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend\n",
    "  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;\n",
    "  But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,\n",
    "  And kept unused the user so destroys it.\n",

    "  Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,\n",
    "  But that thou none lov'st is most evident:\n",

    "  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,\n",
    "  And many maiden gardens, yet unset,\n",
    "  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,\n",
    "  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:\n",

    "  The age to come would say 'This poet lies;\n",

    "  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,\n",
    "  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;\n",
    "  A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,\n",
